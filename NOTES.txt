CHIP-8 CPU quirks documented well here:

    https://github.com/mir3z/chip8-emu

    Load/store quirks - Instructions LD [I], Vx and LD Vx, [I] 
    increments value of I register but some CHIP-8 programs 
    assumes that they don't.
	
    Shift quirks - Shift instructions originally shift register 
    VY and store results in register VX. Some CHIP-8 programs 
    incorrectly assumes that the VX register is shifted by this 
    instruction, and VY remains unmodified.

Things to try:

    -10 steps(fetch + decode + execute) per cycle?
        - 1 step = (fetch + decode + execute)?
        - Any documentation to back this up?

	-Release key immediatley after being pressed
        - After a key is pressed, the next cycle shouldn't 
          modify the key states?
          - THis may fix Clock-Program.ch8
