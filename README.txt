Chip8 v1.0

A Chip-8 Emultaor written in C++ using the Simple 
DirectMedia Layer library.

Most games seem to work properly. Probably still a 
few bugs here and there. No audio implemented.

Control keys:

	1234          
	qwert 
	asdf
	zxcv
	
	
Note: You may build from scratch but be aware that 
the makefiles expect the SDL libraries to be in a 
folder named "frameworks" for everything to compile 
properly.

Enjoy!
