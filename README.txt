Chip8 v1.0

A Chip-8 interpreter written in C++ using the Simple 
DirectMedia Layer library.

I have included pre-built binaries for both Windows
and Mac OS X (.exe file and .app bundle respectively)

Most games seem to work properly, however there are 
still quite a few bugs here and there. 
No audio is implemented. A work in progress.

Controls --> keybindings

123C    -->    1234          
456D    -->    qwert 
789E    -->    asdf
A0BF    -->    zxcv
	
	
Note: If for any reason you need to build from scratch,
be aware that the makefiles expect the SDL libraries to 
be in a folder named "frameworks" for everything to 
compile properly.

Enjoy!
