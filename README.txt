Chip8 v1.0
Thomas Daley

A Chip-8 Interpreter written in C++ using the Simple 
DirectMedia Layer library.

Most games seem to work properly. Probably still a 
few bugs here and there. No audio implemented.

There are 16 keys mapped in this layout:

	1234          
	qwert 
	asdf
	zxcv

Enjoy!
